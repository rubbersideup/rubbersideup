  <h1>Rubber Side Up</h1>
  A project exploring Main Roads WA cycling crash statistics, for <a href="http://perth.govhack.org">GovHack 2015</a>, a weekend-long annual event promoting the use of Australian (and now NZ) government data. 

  <p><b>I am currently updating this site to make it more user friendly and will include more analysis as I further process the Main Roads database. Check back here often!</b></p>

This project provides a tool for analysing statistics and interrogating individual reported traffic accidents involving cyclists around WA from 2010 to 2014, with the data provided by Main Roads WA. Crashes are classified by severity (fatalities, requiring hospitalisation, other medial attention, or property damage), and what sort of other vehicles are involved. Crashes can be shown based on these classifications, or based on the speed limit of the local roads. From the Department of Transport bike path and bike network routes, we can determine the distance of each crash from the nearest designated bike route and analyse the locations of crashes relative to cycling infrastructure. Data for the number of people involved was not provided. Importantly, the at-fault party was not identified either. I aim to update this page over time to add more data from WA and stats from other states and possibly bring the website design into the 21st century ;) Please visit again soon!

<p>
Stats have been collated over this time period and are grouped by vehicle type, by severity and speed limit. Various graphs displaying the breakdown of crashes for various pairings of these categories (and CSVs containing the data) are available from the link above. More data coming soon.
