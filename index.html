  <h1>Rubber Side Up</h1>
  A project exploring Main Roads WA cycling crash statistics, for <a href="http://perth.govhack.org">GovHack 2015</a>.

<p>
This project provides a tool for analysing statistics and interrogating individual reported traffic accidents involving cyclists around WA from 2010 to 2014, with the data provided by Main Roads WA. Crashes are classified by severity (fatalities, requiring hospitalisation, property damage), and what sort of other vehicles are involved. Crashes can be hidden or displayed from view based on these classifications, or based on the speed limit of the local roads, also available from Main Roads. From the Department of Transport bike path and bike network routes, we can determine the distance of each crash from the nearest designated bike route and analyse the locations of crashes relative to cycling infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
Stats have been collated over this time period and are grouped by vehicle type, by severity and speed limit. Various graphs displaying the breakdown of crashes for various pairings of these categories (and CSVs containing the data) are available from the link below.
